            We are two brothers from Chicago that are trying to pay back our
            debt. We can help you with SEO, SEM, content marketing and whatever
            else.

              We grew up in downtown Chicago, and we used to play in a band.
              Jake loves fried chicken, and Elwood loves dry white toast.
            </p>
            <p class="company-info__col-desc">
              While the band didn't make it, the hard work we put in trying to
              promote it sure did. Like a lot of people, we needed a website,
              and we needed to rank. The "experts" didn't seem to know what they
              were talking about, so we figured it out on our own.
            </p>

          <article class="company-info__col company-info__col--margin">
            <h2 class="company-info__col-heading">
              We can do all sorts of great stuff
            </h2>
            <p class="company-info__col-desc company-info__col-desc--margin">
              Honestly most people in this industry seem to be full of crap. We
              don't care what you've heard, or what others have told you, we get
              results and at the end of the day, what else matters?
            </p>
            <p class="company-info__col-desc">
              So sure, maybe we're a bit different from what you'd expect, but
              if you want to rank, market, and build your way to the top, we're
              the brothers for you.
